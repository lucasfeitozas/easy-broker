## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Create a new branch** for your feature/fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Write tests** for your changes
3. **Update documentation** if necessary
4. **Ensure all tests pass**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

5. **Check code style**:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

### Submitting the Pull Request

1. **Push your branch** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Reference to related issues
   - Screenshots (if applicable)
   - Test coverage information

3. **Fill out the Pull Request template** completely

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Keep it focused**: One feature/fix per PR
- **Keep it small**: Smaller PRs are easier to review
- **Write good commit messages**: Use conventional commits format
- **Update tests**: Ensure your changes are covered by tests
- **Update documentation**: Keep docs in sync with code changes

### Commit Message Format

We use [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/):

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat(api): add new endpoint for stock transactions
fix(database): resolve connection timeout issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## Style Guides

### TypeScript Style Guide

We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting:

```bash
# Run linting
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Format code
npm run format
```

### Code Style Rules

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code structure and patterns
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use async/await instead of Promises where possible

### Database Style Guide

- Use descriptive table and column names
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Add appropriate indexes
- Include proper foreign key relationships
- Document schema changes in migrations

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for business logic
- Write integration tests for API endpoints
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies
